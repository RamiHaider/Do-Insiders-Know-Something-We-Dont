There are multiple reasons as to why we may want to do this.  \n","1. Size of our data  \n","2. Dynamic Updates on backend  \n","3. Dynamic Use for visualizations\n","\n","Let's discuss each of these in a little more detail for the reasoning.\n","\n","## Size of Data  \n","We will be using nearly two decades worth of insider trading data. This will equate to hundreds of thousands of rows ($\\approx$ 464,000 rows, $\\approx$ 460,000 after removing tickers 'None'). Our unique research problem is that we have to use each of these rows as a separate query to yahoo finance for the given time period. We will run into throttling issues if we query yahoo finance too often. If we setup a cloud based database, it will be easy for us to batch update the file, updating as the rate limit allows. It is expected that this will take multiple days in order to propegate price data on every transaction. We have 11,200 unique data symbols to query.  \n","\n","## Updating The Backend  \n","Every quarter, a new zip file is release for all insider trading activity that occured for that qurater. It would be great if we could continue to update the database every quarter for new trades so that we can continually monitor the accuracy of our analysis and watch for data drift. The benefit of using a database like postgress is that we can update the backend of the database without impacting the front end of our project, an interactive dashboard demonstrating the results.\n","\n","## Updating the Front End\n","The front end of our data will be an interactive dashboard that we can visualize different questions with. Which position has the most predictive power in terms of buying/selling their stock at opportune times. Are specific individuals better then others? Does market cap play a role in how well an insider does? We don't want this dashboard to go down while we are updating the data every quarter, so hosting from a database will allow us to continually pull data even while updating.\n","\n","## Postgres Rational  \n","I chose to work with postgres as that was the basis of our SQL class. I also think that it will allow us to demonstrate our comman line coding with psql and show our SQL language proficiency.\n","\n","## Pipeline\n","1. Setup a limited access unique username and password for access.  \n","2. Create Database on our AWS RDS postgress instance\n","3. Create a table that can be populated with all of our columns and datatypes\n","4. Upload the CSV file to the database (leaving the historical price columns empty).\n","5. Use SQL to pull data with no values of histroical price data (batch) based on stock ticker  \n","6. Query yahoo finance for appropriate historical price data\n","7. Update database with historical price data.\n","\n","\n","username: user_SIADS593  \n","password: 'ktr_593_*^$'\n","\n","Database: SIADS593\n","\n","Table: insider_trading  \n","\n","\n","\n"],"metadata":{"id":"2BKwEDgdilmo"}}]}
